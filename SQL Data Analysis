Part 1: Energy Stability and Market Outages
Energy stability is one of the key themes the AEMR management team cares about. To ensure energy security and reliability, AEMR needs to understand the following:
      a. What are the most common outage types and how long do they tend to last?
      b. How frequently do the outages occur?
      c. Are there any energy providers that have more outages than their peers which may indicate that these providers are unreliable?

Part 1: Energy Stability and Market Outages
Energy stability is one of the key themes the AEMR management team cares about. To ensure energy security and reliability, AEMR needs to understand the following:
What are the most common outage types and how long do they tend to last?
How frequently do the outages occur?
Are there any energy providers that have more outages than their peers which may indicate that these providers are unreliable?

Part Two: Energy losses and market relaibility

When an energy provider provides energy to the market, they are making a commitment to the market and saying;
“We will supply X amount of energy to the market under a contractual obligation.” However, in a situation where the outages are forced, 
the energy provider intended to provide energy but is unable to provide energy and is forced offline. If many energy providers are forced offline 
at the same time, it could cause an energy security risk that AEMR needs to mitigate.
To ensure this doesn’t happen, the AEMR is interested in exploring the following questions:
Of the outage types in 2016 and 2017, what percent were forced outages?
What was the average duration for a forced outage during both 2016 and 2017? Have we seen an increase in the average duration of forced outages?
Which energy providers tended to be the most unreliable?
------------------------------------------

Questions: 1) Of the outage types in 2016 and 2017, what are the respective percentages composed of Forced Outage(s)?
Question 1.1: Write a SQL Statement to COUNT the total number of approved forced outage events for 2016 and 2017. Order by Reason and Year.
-------SQL Query-----------
SELECT Reason, COUNT(Reason) AS Total_Number_Outage_Events, YEAR(Start_Time) AS Year
FROM AEMR
WHERE Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Reason, Year
ORDER BY Reason
-------------------------------------------

Question 1.2: Building upon the query you completed in the previous question, 
calculate the proportion of outages that were forced for both 2016 and 2017. Order from 2016 to 2017.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
------SQL Query---------
SELECT
	SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = 'Forced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as Total_Number_Forced_Outage_Events
	,Count(*) as Total_Number_Outage_Events
	,CAST((CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN Reason = 'Forced' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)AS DECIMAL(18,2))/CAST(Count(*) AS DECIMAL(18,2)))*100 AS DECIMAL(18,2)) 
  as Forced_Outage_Percentage
	,Year(Start_Time) as Year
FROM
	AEMR
WHERE
	Status = 'Approved'
GROUP BY
	Year(Start_Time)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

2) What was the average duration for a forced outage during both 2016 and 2017? Have we seen an
increase in the average duration of forced outages?
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 2.1: Write a SQL statement to calculate the AVERAGE duration of forced outage events rounded to 2 decimal places, 
as well as the AVERAGE amount of energy lost (MW) (also rounded to 2 decimal places)
for both 2016 and 2017 due to forced outages. Don't forget to order this by YEAR.
----------SQL Query--------------------------
SELECT Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year,
ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) as Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,Start_Time,End_Time)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR 
WHERE Reason='Forced' AND Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Status,Year
ORDER BY Year, Status

Question 2.2 Write a SQL statement to compare the AVERAGE duration of each individual outage event (Forced, Consequential, Planned and Opportunistic) 
for both 2016 and 2017. Order from 2016 to 2017.
---------SQL Query---------
SELECT Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year,
ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) as Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,Start_Time,End_Time)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR 
WHERE Reason='Forced' 
GROUP BY Status,Year
ORDER BY Year, Status
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.1: Write a SQL Statement to calculate the AVERAGE duration and AVERAGE energy lost (MW) for all approved outages where 
the reason is equal to Forced for each participant code,
Ordered By AVERAGE energy loss (Avg_Outage_MW_Loss) and Year in descending order.
SELECT Participant_Code, Status, Reason, YEAR(Start_Time) as Year,
ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) as Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
ROUND(AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(minute,Start_Time,End_Time)),2) AS Average_Outage_Duration_Time_Minutes
FROM AEMR 
WHERE Reason='Forced' 
GROUP BY Status,Year,Participant_Code
ORDER BY Year, Status
-------------------------------------------------------------

Question 3.2: Write a SQL statement to calculate the Average Outage (MW) Loss and Overall Summed Outage (MW) loss for each 
participant code where the Status is Approved and the Outage Reason is Forced across both 2016 and 2017.
This data extract should be sorted in descending order for Summed_Energy_Lost, and ordered from 2016 to 2017.
The output of your query should have the following column headers. Please note that, as this is a tricky query, 
we’ve included an example of what the output would look like for one participant code:
Please also note that for grading purposes, you should use the YEAR() function 
when extracting the Year data from the Start_Time Column as opposed to EXTRACT().

---------SQL Query--------
SELECT Participant_Code,
       Facility_Code,
       Status, 
       Reason, 
       YEAR(Start_Time) as Year,
ROUND(AVG(Outage_MW),2) as Avg_Outage_MW_Loss,
ROUND(SUM(Outage_MW),2) as Summed_Energy_Lost
FROM AEMR
WHERE Reason='Forced' AND Status='Approved'
GROUP BY Year,Participant_Code,Facility_Code
ORDER BY Year, Status
